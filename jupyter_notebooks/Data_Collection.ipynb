    "## Objectives\n",
    "The main objectives of this notebook are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download data from Kaggle and save it as raw data for further processing.\n",
    "2. Clean and organize the downloaded data into two equal-sized groups - one for training and one for testing and validation.\n",
    "3. Save the data into the \"input_datasets\" directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inputs\n",
    "The notebook requires the following input:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Kaggle JSON file: This file contains the authentication key for accessing the Kaggle dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Description\n",
    "The dataset for this project consists of 4208 images, which are evenly split between two categories:\n",
    "1. Images of healthy cherry leaves.\n",
    "2. Images of cherry leaves infected with powdery mildew.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outputs\n",
    "The expected outcomes of this notebook are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All images will be resized to an appropriate image size for both the healthy and infected groups.\n",
    "2. The dataset will be divided into three sets:\n",
    "   - Training set\n",
    "   - Testing set\n",
    "   - Validation set\n",
    "   \n",
